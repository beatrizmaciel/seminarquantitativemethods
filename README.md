# seminarquantitativemethods

Hello, World!

This repository is about my studies in R. In Sociological research we need to analyse data and we use R for that.
The Seminar of Quantitative Methods was offered by University of Lisbon. I've made some exercises with mtcars' library, creating graphics and analysing data.
The course was offered by Lea Heyne, Tiago Andr√© Casal Silva and Roberto Pannico.
